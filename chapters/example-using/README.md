# Example Using ([Hashing Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

The [Go programming language](http://golang.org/) has some built-in packages for **hashing**. These are:

* [import "hash"](https://pkg.go.dev/hash)
* [import "crypto/md5"](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/md5)
* [import "crypto/sha1"](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/sha1)
* [import "crypto/sha256"](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/sha256)
* [import "crypto/sha512"](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/sha512)

These implement some well-known and popular hashing algorithms.

We are going to cover each of these Go packages — but later, in a following chapter, we will implement some **hash functions** ourselves from scratch.

But for now, let's learn how to use the **hash functions** that are built into the [Go programming language](http://golang.org/) —
