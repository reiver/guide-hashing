## Do It All

Do NOT skip any sections.

Do NOT skip any sections!

Do NOT skip any sections!!

**Do _all_ the sections.**

Even if they seem easy to you â€” still, do _all_ the sections!

The point of this **guide** is _not_ to challenge you; the point of this **guide** is to help you become familiar with **hashing**, and to correct any mistakes or misunderstandings you might have early on.

## Do It In Order

**And do all the chapters in the order that they appear in this _guide_.**

A particular chapter can depend on the knowledge gained in previous chapter. You need to do them in the order they appear in this **guide**.

## Coaching

The point of you going through this **guide** is that, after you complete each assignment, then **you show your work to someone more experienced with the _hashing_, so that they can give you feedback, tips, etc, so you can learn _hashing_ faster**.
